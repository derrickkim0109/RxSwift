The Easiest to Understand Privacy Policy

RxMarbles doesn't store your data.

We do you use Crashlytics to grab crashes and fix them as soon as possible.
 - Crashlytics [Privacy Policy until April 27, 2018](https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf)

If we were to change this in the future, we will always allow you to opt-in.

That's all there is to understand. That was easy.
